# Machine Learning for Social Science #
### Applying machine learning with examples and concerns of social scientists, focusing on causal inference, estimating uncertainty, robustness and policy applications. ##

## Course Description
This course is designed with social scientists in mind, by which it is meant simply that it assumes an interest in certain concerns that are not always common among computer scientists and others who do machine learning. While I hope the course may be useful more broadly, it will be of particular interest to social scientists due to a focus on the following areas:
1. **Assumptions and Research Design** We will compare the approach and assumptions of machine learning to the econometric approach more familiar to political scientists and economists.
2. **Causal Inference** We will also approach the use of machine learning with the causal inference framework in mind, and think about how machine learning may add additional problems, or help in analyzing data with testing theories and examining relationships that may be plagued by selection bias.
3. **Applications** The examples used and applications examined will be drawn from social science research.


## Prerequisites

This course assumes basic familiarity with machine learning approaches and algorithms as well as econometrics (although these are reviewed in Part 1).
